<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![StudyBot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This project is a Discord bot designed for students to be able to thrive studying collaboratively within a virtual environment such as Discord. The motivation behind the creation of this project was the lifestyle switch which the pandemic brought forth for students like myself, and being able to provide a means of continuing social studying environments online.

Features Include:
* Questionbank capabilities to test yourself and others to study for upcoming examinations
* Dictionary commands to get definitions of words
* Wiki commands to get summarized content regarding a topic
* Translation commands to integrate studying, sharing, and learning other languages
